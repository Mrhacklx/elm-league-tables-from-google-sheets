This project is bootstrapped with [Create Elm App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app).

Below you will find some information on how to perform basic tasks.

# End to end test coverage

The "End to End" tests don't cover everything, and I think don't test that app as deployed. It is possible to do this in Elm via Selenium, but its a bit of a faff so I've compromised.

The following are not covered, so need to do manual testing when changing them

- ./Main.elm
- ./index.js
